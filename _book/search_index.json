You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

Here are picture examples: Overview of Habitats Species by Habitat Time Series We’ve identified 3 phases of development to successfully generate this produce for any given setting: Design audience: managers, scientists Implementation audience: data and web technicians Feedback Gather feeback (like A/B testing) from users and iterate on Design and Implementation. 5.1.2 Design Process audience: managers, scientists What are the key habitats for your study area? Within these habitats, what are the key species and indicators? For these species and indicators, what datasets are available to inform them? What is the minimum criteria for inclusion of dataset? eg &gt; 5 years of surveys covering &gt; 50% of study area For a given dataset what are the key metrics and how do the values get binned into different categories? Example categories: unprecedented decreasing decreasing stable increasing unprecedented increasing data deficient 5.1.3 Implementation Details audience: data and web technicians This product is intended for hosting on a simple web server, without need for backend server-side programming. It will be generated from data products on a daily basis and involves the following elemnts: Infographic. These will be rendered using scalable vector graphics (SVG) icons color coded and clickable. Time-series plots. These interactive plots will be pre-generated from parameterized Rmarkdown documents. 5.1.4 Gather Feedback and Iterate Gather feeback (like A/B testing) from users and iterate on Design and Implementation.
