## Setup Authentication with SSH keys

- [How To Set Up SSH Keys on Ubuntu 16.04 | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-1604)


Note that `ssh-keygen -m PEM` is needed for logging into Amazon servers:

- [Amazon EC2 Key Pairs - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws)

  > SSH private key file format must be PEM (for example, use ssh-keygen -m PEM to convert the OpenSSH key into the PEM format)

### Login

Once the key is generated on the server, logging into a terminal is simply a matter of specifying location of key file and the user@server:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pem bbest@imars-mbon.marine.usf.edu
```
